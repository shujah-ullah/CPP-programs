In the Rectangle Class 1 we have problem of DATA HIDING.
for instance user/programmer assigns vaue -5 as length to Recatngle
r1->length = -5;
then area and parameter would be -ive valued also, so this is an error.
it occur due to reason that user has direct access to data of program which should be avoided.
this bring us the concept of DATA HIDING which is impemented in Rectangle class 2.
