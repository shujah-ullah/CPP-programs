 Constructor: 
Constructor is member function of class which initializes data members at the time of object creation; Setter function initializes data members after when object is created.

Properties of Constructors:

1. Constructors have same name as of our Class.

2. If there is no Constructor implemented in the code then by default there exist a constructor which is called by Compiler Automatically.
3. There are following types of Constructors:
	Default Constructor.
	Parameterless Constructor.
	Parametrized Constructor.
	Copy Constructor >>>>Shallow Copy>>>>>Deep Copy.

Copy Constructor.....
Copy Constructor takes an object as Argument and copies properties of that object to create a new object.
so we have an object which is already constructed and we want to create another same object we will use Copy Constructor.

example: We have Rectangle r1 of size 4*2 we pass r1 as Argument to Copy constructor it will create another Rectangle r2 of size same 4*2.

****SHALLOW COPY****
Not suitable for DMA
****DEEP COPY****
Suitable for DMA because it creates new objects dynamically.
